# System Exchange 
## version 5.x


**Objective with Version 5 is to introduce new features to the system.**

These features include:
- Delink Saba Ba Lar and Numero Million Games: Both games can now be played individually.
- Soft Wallet Feature: This feature allows players to deposit money into their soft wallet before making transactions. It helps to reduce latency, improve accuracy, and enables players to transfer their wallet balance to others or request balance from others.
- Affiliate and Offer Code Concept: Players with a valid Offer or Affiliate code will receive bonuses and extra tickets. The affiliate code provides benefits to both the player and the affiliate organization/individual/agent, while the offer code is solely for the player's benefit.
